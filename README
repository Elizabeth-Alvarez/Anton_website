My friend wanted his personal website to hold a more interactive environment for the user. We decided that a page transition within the menu tabs would be simple enough that the user wouldn’t be bombarded with effects but engaging enough to read thoroughly. I used Pedro Botelho’s set of transitioning pages and altered the snippet I needed to achieve his request. Page transition:http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/05/07/a-collection-of-page-transitions/
