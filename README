Renovated a friend’s website to add a better functionality and user experience. My friend and I decided that a page transition within the menu tab would be simple enough that the user would not be bombarded with effects but engaging enough to read thoroughly. Used a plug-in (Pedro Botelho) to help enable the page transitions.
