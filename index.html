                	My name is Anton, thank you for coming to my website. This website is here for me to tell you a little about myself and also show you what I have going on. My plan is to keep updating this site on a regular basis for you to see. Also please let me know if I need to fix anything on this site. I handwrote it by myself. <br/><br/>
			        Thank you, Anton <br/> <br/>
                    
                    Quick info about me:<br />
					I graduated from UCSD with a major in Electrical Engineering in 2012. My passion
					has always been in the field of electronics and programming. Right now I'm currently working as a manufacturing engineer but
					hope to find myself continuously working on embedded projects and web development projects
					because I like to write software and also work on hardware.

					Haha, no really I would like to think that I'm a down to earth kind of guy. I love talking about electronics and my two favorite companies in the whole world are Sony and Google, in that order. Sorry for any others that might be reading this. I feel like I have so many things going on that I want to work on and do. Recently, I built my own little home file server using Apache2, which I need to update still. At the moment I'm working on updating this site and my other site at Technomz.com, check out the link on the left side of this page. I used to be a big gamer but recently I haven't had the time to                      play games. I'm working on Android stuff on my own and also keep trying to learn new languages. At the moment I'm taking on Spanish, Romanian, Chinese and have tried to start German and Japanese but not having the time or someone to speak with is sometimes difficult. Well that's it for now, if I get an idea of how to properly edit this page then I will do so at that time. <br/><br/>
					Sincerely, Anton

					Haven't had any problems yet except for an unusual screen issue that was resolved with a restart and some weird flickering when unplugging a usb flashdrive. Though the video card is a beast and handles everything I've thrown at it so far. It's super quiet and runs cool. Not overclocked and I'm extremely happy with it.
